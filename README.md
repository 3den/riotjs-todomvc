## Implementation

The TodoMVC application is structured according to the [Riot documentation](https://moot.it/riotjs/docs/) about "Building modular applications with Riot.js".

Riot's applications should be divided in well defined modules. Those modules should loosely coupled modules to make then easy reused and tested.

* **Models**: Haddles the data and events related to the its changes.
* **Presenters**: Handles the UI and can bind or trigger events to the given **model**.
* **Routers**: Handle changes on the route and can trigger events on the given **model**.
* **Tests**: Riot's also include a very simple BDD framework that can be used on node or the browser.


## Running
